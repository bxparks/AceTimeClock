# AceTime Clock

[![AUnit Tests](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock/actions/workflows/aunit_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock/actions/workflows/aunit_tests.yml)

The AceTimeClock library provides various `Clock` classes to retrieve and
synchronize the real time clock from different sources. The different clock
sources are converted to a 32-bit signed integer (`int32_t`) that
represents the number of seconds since a fixed point in the past called the
**epoch**. The epoch in this library is defined to be 2000-01-01T00:00:00 UTC
for compatibility with the [AceTime](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
companion library.

The following clock sources are supported:

* the built-in `millis()` timer clock
* a [DS3231 RTC](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html)
chip
* the generic [STM32 RTC Clock](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC)
* the special [STM32F1 RTC Clock](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC/issues/29)
* an [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) server
  using a hand-crafted NTP client
* the SNTP client on ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms
    * the documentation for this is almost non-existent
    * try https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?p=75141 and expanding the
      internet search from there
* a Unix `time()` clock
    * when using [EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino)

A special version of the `Clock` class called the `SystemClock` provides an
auto-incrementing "epoch seconds" that can be access very quickly and cheaply
across all Arduino compatible systems. At a minimum, it should handle at least
10 requests per second, but the current implementation should be able to handle
1000 to 1M requests per second, depending on the processor.

We cannot use the `time()` function from the `time.h` C-library because it is
not available on all Arduino platforms. On the AVR platform, the value of the
`time()` function does not auto-increment. It must be incremented from an
*external* process (e.g. in an Interrupt Service Routine, ISR) which must call
the `system_tick()` function exactly once a second. On the SAMD21 and Teensy
platforms, the `time.h` header file does not exist.

This library was part of the [AceTime](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
library, but extracted into a separate library to manage the complexity of both
libraries. The AceTime library provides the mechanism for converting the epoch
seconds from AceTimeClock into human-readable date and time in different time
zones. AceTimeClock currently has a dependency on AceTime, but that may go away
in the future.

This library can be an alternative to the Arduino Time
(https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time) library.

**Version**: v1.2.1 (2022-11-06)

<a name="Installation"></a>
## Installation

The latest stable release is available in the Arduino Library Manager in the
IDE. Search for "AceTimeClock". Click install. The Library Manager should
automatically install AceTimeClock and its dependent libraries:

* AceTimeClock (https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock)
* AceTime (https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
* AceCommon (https://github.com/bxparks/AceCommon)
* AceSorting (https://github.com/bxparks/AceSorting)
* AceWire (https://github.com/bxparks/AceWire)
* AceRoutine (https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine)

The development version can be installed by cloning the above repos manually.
You can copy over these directories to the `./libraries` directory used by the
Arduino IDE. (The result is a set of directories named
`./libraries/AceTimeClock`, `./libraries/AceTime`, and so on). Or you can create
symlinks from `./libraries` to these directories. Or you can `git clone`
directly into the `./libraries` directory.

The `develop` branch contains the latest development.
The `master` branch contains the stable releases.

<a name="SourceCode"></a>
### Source Code

The source files are organized as follows:

* `src/AceTimeClock.h` - main header file
* `src/ace_time/clock/` - system clock from RTC or NTP sources
  (`ace_time::clock`)
* `src/ace_time/hw/` - thin hardware abstraction layer (`ace_time::hw`)
* `src/ace_time/testing/` - files used in unit tests (`ace_time::testing`)
* `tests/` - unit tests using [AUnit](https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit)
* `examples/` - example programs and benchmarks

The main Clock classes are under `src/ace_time/clock` (instead of
`src/ace_time_clock` for example) for backwards compatibility with the code when
these classes were inside the AceTime library.

<a name="Dependencies"></a>
### Dependencies

To use the AceTimeClock library, client apps must install the following
libraries at a minimum:

* AceTimeClock (https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock)
* AceTime v1.8.0 or later (https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime)
* AceCommon (https://github.com/bxparks/AceCommon)
* AceSorting (https://github.com/bxparks/AceSorting)

The following libraries are optional because they are needed only by specific
classes and only if the client application uses them. For convenience, they are
listed in the `depends` parameter of `libraries.properties` so that they are
installed automatically by the Arduino Library Manager:

* AceWire (https://github.com/bxparks/AceWire), needed by `DS3231Clock`.
* AceRoutine (https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine), needed by
  `SystemClockCoroutine`

Various programs in the `examples/` directory may have additional external
dependencies. The comment section near the top of the `*.ino` file will usually
have more precise dependency information. Some of these additional libraries
are:

* Arduino Time Lib (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time)
* Arduino Timezone (https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone)

If you want to run the unit tests or validation tests using a Linux or MacOS
machine, you need:

* AUnit (https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit)
* EpoxyDuino (https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino)
* EspMock (https://github.com/hsaturn/EspMock)

### HelloSystemClockLoop

This is the example code for using the `SystemClock` taken from
[examples/HelloSystemClockLoop](examples/HelloSystemClockLoop).

```C++
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <AceTime.h>
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::acetime_t;
using ace_time::ZonedDateTime;
using ace_time::TimeZone;
using ace_time::BasicZoneProcessor;
using ace_time::zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles;
using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;

// ZoneProcessor instances should be created statically at initialization time.
static BasicZoneProcessor pacificProcessor;

static SystemClockLoop systemClock(nullptr /*reference*/, nullptr /*backup*/);

void printCurrentTime() {
  acetime_t now = systemClock.getNow();

  // Create a time
  auto pacificTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles,
      &pacificProcessor);
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forEpochSeconds(now, pacificTz);
  pacificTime.printTo(Serial);
  Serial.println();
}

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // Wait until Serial is ready - Leonardo/Micro

  systemClock.setup();

  // Creating timezones is cheap, so we can create them on the fly as needed.
  auto pacificTz = TimeZone::forZoneInfo(&zonedb::kZoneAmerica_Los_Angeles,
      &pacificProcessor);

  // Set the SystemClock using these components.
  auto pacificTime = ZonedDateTime::forComponents(
      2019, 6, 17, 19, 50, 0, pacificTz);
  systemClock.setNow(pacificTime.toEpochSeconds());
}

// Do NOT use delay() here.
void loop() {
  static acetime_t prevNow = systemClock.getNow();
  systemClock.loop();
  acetime_t now = systemClock.getNow();
  if (now - prevNow >= 2) {
    printCurrentTime();
    prevNow = now;
  }
}
```

This will start by setting the SystemClock to 2019-06-17T19:50:00-07:00,
then printing the system time every 2 seconds:
```
2019-06-17T19:50:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
2019-06-17T19:50:02-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
2019-06-17T19:50:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
...
```

## User Guide

<a name="Headers"></a>
### Headers and Namespaces

Only a single header file `AceTimeClock.h` is required to use this library.
The code in this library previously lived in the AceTime library under the
`ace_time::clock` namespace. To preserve backwards compatibility, the directory
structure and namespace have been retained. To use the Clock classes without
prepending the namespace prefixes, use the following `using` directive:

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
using namespace ace_time::clock;
```

<a name="ClassHierarchy"></a>
### Class Hierarchy

The class hierarchy diagram for these various classes looks like the following.
The upward arrow means "is-subclass-of", the side-ways arrow means "depends on",
and the diamond-line means "is-aggregation-of":

```
     (0..2)
.----------- Clock
|            ^    ^
|            |     \
|            |      DS3231Clock -----> hw::DS3231
|            |      EspSntpClock ----> configTime(), time()
|            |      NtpClock --------> WiFi, ESP8266WiFi
|            |      StmRtcClock -----> hw::StmRtc
|            |      Stm32F1Clock ----> hw::Stm32F1Rtc
|            |      UnixClock -------> time()
|            |
`------<> SystemClock
           ^       ^
          /         \
SystemClockLoop      SystemClockCoroutine
```

These are arranged in the following C++ namespaces:

* `ace_time::clock::Clock`
    * `ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock`
    * `ace_time::clock::EspSntpClock`
    * `ace_time::clock::NtpClock`
    * `ace_time::clock::StmRtcClock`
    * `ace_time::clock::Stm32F1Clock`
    * `ace_time::clock::UnixClock`
    * `ace_time::clock::SystemClock`
        * `ace_time::clock::SystemClockCoroutine`
        * `ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop`

The classes in the `ace_time::hw` namespace provide a thin hardware abstraction
layer between the specific `Clock` subclass and the underlying hardware or
network device.

<a name="ClockClass"></a>
### Clock Class

This is an abstract class which provides 3 functionalities:

* `setNow(acetime_t now)`: set the current time
* `acetime_ getNow()`: get current time (blocking)
* `sendRequest()`, `isResponseReady()`, `readResponse()`: get current time
  (non-blocking)

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class Clock {
  public:
    static const acetime_t kInvalidSeconds = LocalTime::kInvalidSeconds;

    virtual void setNow(acetime_t epochSeconds) {}
    virtual acetime_t getNow() const = 0;

    virtual void sendRequest() const {}
    virtual bool isResponseReady() const { return true; }
    virtual acetime_t readResponse() const { return getNow(); }
};

}
}
```

Examples of the `Clock` include an NTP client, a GPS client, or a DS3231 RTC
chip.

Not all clocks can implement the `setNow()` method (e.g. an NTP client)
so the default implementation `Clock::setNow()` is a no-op. However, all clocks
are expected to provide a `getNow()` method. On some clocks, the `getNow()`
function can consume a large amount (many seconds) of time (e.g. `NtpClock`) so
these classes are expected to provide a non-blocking implementation of the
`getNow()` functionality through the `sendRequest()`, `isResponseReady()` and
`readResponse()` methods. The `Clock` base class provides a default
implementation of the non-blocking API by simply calling the `getNow()` blocking
API, but subclasses are expected to provide the non-blocking interface when
needed.

The `acetime_t` value from `getNow()` can be converted into the desired time
zone using the `ZonedDateTime` and `TimeZone` classes from the AceTime library.

<a name="DS3231ClockClass"></a>
### DS3231Clock Class

**Breaking Change**: AceTime v1.8 moved the `ace_time::clock` classes to
this new `AceTimeClock` library. At the same time, it made a breaking change to
the `DS3231Clock` class. See [Migrating the
DS3231Clock](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime/blob/develop/MIGRATING.md#MigratingTheDS3231Clock)
in the AceTime MIGRATING.md document.

The `DS3231Clock` class uses the DS3231 RTC chip. It contains an internal
temperature-compensated oscillator that counts time in 1 second steps. It is
often connected to a battery or a supercapacitor to survive power failures. The
DS3231 chip stores the time broken down by various date and time components
(i.e. year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds). It contains internal logic that
knows about the number of days in an month, and leap years. It supports dates
from 2000 to 2099. It does *not* contain the concept of a time zone. Therefore,
The `DS3231Clock` assumes that the date/time components stored on the chip is in
**UTC** time.

The class declaration looks like this:

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

template<typename T_WIREI>
class DS3231Clock: public Clock {
  public:
    explicit DS3231Clock(T_WIREI& wireInterface);

    void setup();
    acetime_t getNow() const override;
    void setNow(acetime_t epochSeconds) override;
};

}
}
```

The `DS3231Clock::getNow()` returns the number of seconds since
AceTime Epoch by converting the UTC date and time components to `acetime_t`
(using `LocalDatetime` internally). Users can convert the epoch seconds
into either an `OffsetDateTime` or a `ZonedDateTime` as needed.

The `DS3231Clock::setup()` should be called from the global `setup()`
function to initialize the object. Here is a sample of that:

```C++
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire

using ace_time::acetime_t;
using ace_time::OffsetDateTime;
using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while(!Serial); // needed for Leonardo/Micro
  ...
  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  dsClock.setNow(0); // 2000-01-01T00:00:00Z
}

void loop() {
  acetime_t nowSeconds = dsClock.getNow();
  // convert epochSeconds to UTC-08:00
  OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime::forEpochSeconds(
      nowSeconds, TimeOffset::forHours(-8));
  odt.printTo(Serial);
  delay(10000); // wait 10 seconds
}
```

See [examples/HelloDS3231Clock](examples/HelloDS3231Clock/) for details on how
to configure and use this class.

It has been claimed that the DS1307 and DS3232 RTC chips have exactly the same
interface as DS3231 when accessing the time and date functionality. I don't have
these chips so I cannot confirm that. Contact @Naguissa
(https://github.com/Naguissa) for more info.

<a name="StmRtcClockClass"></a>
### Stm32RtcClock Class

The `StmRtcClock` uses the `hw::StmRtc` class, which in turn uses the STM32RTC
library (https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC) which provides access to the
internal RTC module inside various STM32 chips. On some dev boards, the `VBat`
pin is exposed and you can connect a battery or super capacitor to preserve the
date and time fields through a power reset.

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class StmRtcClock: public Clock {
  public:
    explicit StmRtcClock() {}

    void setup() {}

    acetime_t getNow() const override;

    void setNow(acetime_t epochSeconds) override;

    bool isTimeSet() const;
};

}
}
```

This class is relatively new (added in v1.4) and may require more extensive
testing. I have done some rough testing on the STM32F103 (Blue Pill) and the
STM32F411 (Black Pill) dev boards.

The `StmRtcClock` uses the `STM32RTC::getInstance()` singleton instance from the
`STM32RTC` library which should be configured in the global
`setup()` function like this (see
[examples/HelloStmRtcClock](examples/HelloStmRtcClock)):

```C++
...
#include <STM32RTC.h>
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
...
using ace_time::clock::StmRtcClock;

...
StmRtcClock stmRtcClock;

void setup() {
  ...
  // Configure the STM32RTC singleton instance
  STM32RTC::getInstance().setClockSource(STM32RTC::LSE_CLOCK);
  STM32RTC::getInstance().begin();
  // STM32RTC::getInstance().begin(true /*reset*/); // use this to reset

  stmRtcClock.setup();
  ...
}
```

See [examples/HelloStmRtcClock](examples/HelloStmRtcClock) for more details
about how to configure and use this class.

The `STM32RTC::setClockSource()` supports 3 clock sources:

* `STM32RTC::LSI_CLOCK` (default)
    * low speed internal
    * not accurate
* `STM32RTC::LSE_CLOCK`
    * low speed external
    * requires a 32.768 kHz external crystal
    * retains timekeeping during power-off through the VBat terminal
* `STM32RTC::HSE_CLOCK`
    * high speed external
    * (I don't know much about this)

The `STM32RTC::begin()` method without arguments configures the object without
resetting the RTC hardware. By default, it uses the `STM32RTC::HOUR_24` flag to
set the RTC chip into 24-hour format. This is required for AceTime which assumes
that the `hour` component is in 24-hour format.

An alternate version of `begin(bool reset)` takes a boolean flag which resets
the RTC chip and clears any previous date-time values. This can be useful during
development and debugging.

Prior to STM32RTC v1.2.0, the STM32RTC library contained a bug on the STM32F1
chip where the date components (year, month, day) were lost upon reset. See
the following issues:

* [STM32RTC#29](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC/issues/29),
* [STM32RTC#32](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC/issues/32),
* [STM32RTC#41](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC/pull/41),
* [Arduino_Core_STM32#266](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32/issues/266)

The bug was fixed with
[STM32RTC#58](https://github.com/stm32duino/STM32RTC/pull/58).

<a name="Stm32F1ClockClass"></a>
### Stm32F1Clock Class

The `Stm32F1Clock` is a class that is specifically designed to work on an
STM32F1 chip, and specifically using the `LSE_CLOCK` mode (low speed external).
The purpose of this class is to avoid the bug in the STM32RTC library that
caused the date components to be lost after a power reset. (See the
[StmRtcClockClass](#StmRtcClockClass) subsection above).

The `Stm32F1Clock` class bypasses the STM32RTC library and the HAL code for the
STM32F1. Instead, the `hw::Stm32F1Rtc` class writes the AceTime epochSeconds
directly into the 32-bit RTC counter on the STM32F1. Technical details can be
found in the [docstring for
Stm32F1Clock](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock/blob/develop/src/ace_time/clock/Stm32F1Clock.h).

The power reset bug was fixed in STM32RTC v1.2.0, so the `Stm32F1Clock` class
may no longer be necessary. However, [MemoryBenchmark](examples/MemoryBenchmark)
shows that the `Stm32F1Clock` class is 4kB smaller than `StmRtcClock`. So if
flash memory is tight, then the `Stm32F1Clock` may still be worth using.

The "Blue Pill" board already contains an external 32.768 kHz crystal chip
attached to pins PC14 and PC15. The `LSE_CLOCK` mode uses external crystal to
drive the internal 32-bit RTC counter, and has the nice property of being the
only clock that works while the chip is powered off, as long as a battery or
super capacitor is attached to the `VBat` terminal.

The `Stm32F1Clock` class looks like this:

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class Stm32F1Clock: public Clock {
  public:
    explicit Stm32F1Clock() {}

    void setup();

    acetime_t getNow() const override;

    void setNow(acetime_t epochSeconds) override;
};

}
}
```

The class is configured and used like this:

```C++
...
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
...
using ace_time::clock::Stm32F1Clock;

...
Stm32F1Clock stm32F1Clock;

void setup() {
  ...

  stm32F1Clock.setup();
  ...
}
```

See [examples/HelloStm32F1Clock](examples/HelloStm32F1Clock) for more details
about how to configure and use this class.

I also recommend that nothing should be connected to the PC14 and PC15 pins of
the Blue Pill board, not even the male header pins. The male header pins changed
the capacitance of the oscillator circuit enough to cause my `LSE_CLOCK` to run
5-10% too slow. Removing the pins fixed the problem, giving me a clock that is
accurate to better than 1 second per 48 hours. See for example:

## NtpClock Class

The `NtpClock` class is available on the ESP8266 and ESP32 which have builtin
WiFi capability. (I have not tested the code on the Arduino WiFi shield because
I don't have that hardware.) This class uses an NTP client to fetch the current
time from the specified NTP server. The constructor takes 3 parameters which
have default values so they are optional.

The class declaration looks like this:

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class NtpClock: public Clock {
  public:
    static const uint16_t kConnectTimeoutMillis = 10000;
    static const uint16_t kRequestTimeoutMillis = 1000;

  public:
    explicit NtpClock(
        const char* server = kNtpServerName,
        uint16_t localPort = kLocalPort,
        uint16_t requestTimeout = kRequestTimeoutMillis);

    void setup(
        const char* ssid = nullptr,
        const char* password = nullptr,
        uint16_t connectTimeoutMillis = kConnectTimeoutMillis);

    bool isSetup() const;
    const char* getServer() const;

    acetime_t getNow() const override;

    void sendRequest() const override;
    bool isResponseReady() const override;
    acetime_t readResponse() const override;
};

}
}
```

The constructor takes the name of the NTP server. The default value is
`kNtpServerName` which is `us.pool.ntp.org`. The default `kLocalPort` is set to
8888. And the default `kRequestTimeout` is 1000 milliseconds.

The `setup()` must be called before this class is used. If the `ssid` and
`password` of the WiFi connection is provided, it will attempt to configure the
ESP8266 and ESP32 WiFi stack. If `ssid` is a `nullptr`, the WiFi stack must be
configured separately. This feature was originally provided as a convenience,
but I now recommend that the WiFi stack be configured separately outside of the
`NtpClock::setup()` function. The functionality remains in `NtpClock::setup()`
for backwards compatibility.

Here is a sample of how it can be used:

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::acetime_t;
using ace_time::OffsetDateTime;
using ace_time::clock::NtpClock;

const char SSID[] = ...; // Warning: don't store SSID in GitHub
const char PASSWORD[] = ...; // Warning: don't store passwd in GitHub
static const unsigned long WIFI_TIMEOUT_MILLIS = 15000;

NtpClock ntpClock;

void setupWiFi(
    const char* ssid,
    const char* password,
    unsigned long rebootTimeoutMillis)
{
  // See example/HelloNtpClock/ for an implementation
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while(!Serial); // needed for Leonardo/Micro
  ...

  setupWiFi(SSID, PASSWORD, WIFI_TIMEOUT_MILLIS);

  ntpClock.setup();
  if (ntpClock.isSetup()) {
    Serial.println("Connection failed... try again.");
    return;
  }
}

// Print the NTP time every 5 seconds, in UTC-08:00 time zone.
void loop() {
  acetime_t nowSeconds = ntpClock.getNow();
  // convert epochSeconds to UTC-08:00
  OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime::forEpochSeconds(
      nowSeconds, TimeOffset::forHours(-8));
  odt.printTo(Serial);
  delay(5000); // wait 5 seconds
}
```

See the following examples for more details:

* [examples/HelloNtpClock](examples/HelloNtpClock)
* [examples/HelloNtpClockLazy](examples/HelloNtpClockLazy)

**Security Warning**: You should avoid committing your SSID and PASSWORD into a
public repository like GitHub because they will become public to anyone. Even if
you delete the commit, they can be retrieved from the git history.

<a name="EspSntpClockClass"></a>
### ESP SNTP Clock Class

The `EspSntpClock` class is specifically designed for the ESP8266 and ESP32
platforms, using its built-in SNTP client which synchronizes with the `time()`
function in the C-library.

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class EspSntpClock: public Clock {
  public:
    static const char kDefaultNtpServer[];
    static const uint32_t kDefaultTimeoutMillis = 15000;

    explicit EspSntpClock() {}

    bool setup(
        const char* ntpServer = kDefaultNtpServer,
        uint32_t timeoutMillis = kDefaultTimeoutMillis);

    acetime_t getNow() const override;
};

}
}
```

The class depends on the `WiFi` stack to be configured elsewhere. See
[examples/HelloEspSntpClock](examples/HelloEspSntpClock) for more details about
how configure and use this class.

The `EspSntpClock::setup()` function calls the `configTime()` function provided
by the ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms, with the timezone set to UTC (STD offset and
DST offset are set to 0). The `setup()` method returns `true` on success,
`false` upon timeout. The `kDefaultNtpServer` is "pool.ntp.org".`

The `getNow()` method calls the built-in `time()` function and converts the
64-bit `time_t` Unix epoch seconds used on the ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms to
the 32-bit `acetime_t` epoch seconds used by the AceTime library. In the current
version of AceTime, this is valid until 2068-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.

The SNTP client apparently performs automatic synchronization of the `time()`
function every 1 hour, but the only documentation for this that I can find is in
this
[NTP-TZ-DST](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/esp8266/examples/NTP-TZ-DST)
example file.

**Note**: You use the ESP SNTP service with the AceTime library directly without
going through the `EspSntpClock` class. See
[AceTime/examples/EspTime](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime/tree/develop/examples/EspTime).

<a name="UnixClockClass"></a>
### UnixClock Class

The `UnixClock` is a version of `Clock` that retrieves the epochSeconds from the
`time()` function on a POSIX or Unix compatible environment with a `time.h`
header file. It is currently activated only for EpoxyDuino
(https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) but it could possibly to useful in other
environments, I don't know. Currently, it's used only for testing.

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class UnixClock: public Clock {
  public:
    explicit UnixClock() {}

    void setup() {}

    acetime_t getNow() const override;
};

}
}
```

<a name="SystemClockClass"></a>
### SystemClock Class

The `SystemClock` is a special `Clock` that uses the Arduino built-in `millis()`
method as the source of its time. The biggest advantage of `SystemClock` is that
its `getNow()` has very little overhead so it can be called as frequently as
needed, compared to the `getNow()` method of other `Clock` classes which can
consume a significant amount of time. For example, the `DS3231Clock` must talk
to the DS3231 RTC chip over an I2C bus. Even worse, the `NtpClock` must the talk
to the NTP server over the network which can be unpredictably slow.

Unfortunately, the `millis()` internal clock of most (all?) Arduino boards is
not very accurate and unsuitable for implementing an accurate clock. Therefore,
the `SystemClock` provides the option to synchronize its clock to an external
`referenceClock`.

The other problem with the `millis()` internal clock is that it does not survive
a power failure. The `SystemClock` provides a way to save the current time
to a `backupClock` (e.g. the `DS3231Clock` using the DS3231 chip with battery
backup). When the `SystemClock` starts up, it will read the `backupClock` and
set the current time. When it synchronizes with the `referenceClock`, (e.g. the
`NtpClock`), it saves a copy of it into the `backupClock`.

The `SystemClock` is an abstract class, and this library provides 2 concrete
implementations, `SystemClockLoop` and `SystemClockCoroutine`:

* The `SystemClockLoop` is designed to be called from the global `loop()`
  function.
* The `SystemClockCoroutine` is coroutine designed to be called through the
  AceRoutine (https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine) library.

They implement the periodic maintenance tasks that are required on the
`SystemClock` (see the [System Clock Maintenance Tasks](#SystemClockMaintenance)
subsection below). One of the maintenance tasks is to synchronize the system
clock with an external clock. But getting the time from the external clock is an
expensive process because, for example, it could go over the network to an NTP
server. So the `SystemClockCoroutine::runCoroutine()` and the
`SystemClockLoop::loop()` methods both use the non-block API of the `Clock`
interface to retrieve the external time, which allow other things to to continue
to run on the microcontroller.

```C++
namespace ace_time {
namespace clock {

class SystemClock: public Clock {
  public:
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusOk = 0;
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusError = 1;
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusTimedOut = 2;

    void setup();

    acetime_t getNow() const override;
    void setNow(acetime_t epochSeconds) override;

    bool isInit() const;
    acetime_t getLastSyncTime() const;
    uint8_t getSyncStatusCode() const;
    int32_t getSecondsSinceSyncAttempt() const;
    int32_t getSecondsToSyncAttempt() const;
    int16_t getClockSkew() const;

  protected:
    explicit SystemClock(
        Clock* referenceClock /* nullable */,
        Clock* backupClock /* nullable */);

    Clock* getReferenceClock() const { return mReferenceClock; }

    unsigned long clockMillis() const { return ::millis(); }

    void keepAlive();

    void backupNow(acetime_t nowSeconds);

    void syncNow(acetime_t epochSeconds);
};

class SystemClockLoop : public SystemClock {
  public:
    explicit SystemClockLoop(
        Clock* referenceClock /* nullable */,
        Clock* backupClock /* nullable */,
        uint16_t syncPeriodSeconds = 3600,
        uint16_t initialSyncPeriodSeconds = 5,
        uint16_t requestTimeoutMillis = 1000,
        ace_common::TimingStats* timingStats = nullptr);

    void loop();
};

#if defined(ACE_ROUTINE_VERSION)

class SystemClockCoroutine :
    public SystemClock,
    public ace_routine::Coroutine {
  public:
    explicit SystemClockCoroutine(
        Clock* referenceClock /* nullable */,
        Clock* backupClock /* nullable */,
        uint16_t syncPeriodSeconds = 3600,
        uint16_t initialSyncPeriodSeconds = 5,
        uint16_t requestTimeoutMillis = 1000,
        ace_common::TimingStats* timingStats = nullptr);

    int runCoroutine() override;
};

#endif

}
}
```

The `SystemClockCoroutine` class is available only if you have installed the
[AceRoutine](https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine) library and include its
header **before** `<AceTimeClock.h>`, like this:

```C++
#include <AceRoutine.h> // enables SystemClockCoroutine
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
...
```

<a name="ReferenceClockAndBackupClock"></a>
#### Reference Clock and Backup Clock

The constructor of both `SystemClockLoop` and `SystemClockCoroutine`
takes 2 parameters which are required but are *nullable*:

* the `referenceClock`
    * an instance of the `Clock` class which provides an external clock of high
      accuracy
    * assumed to be expensive to use (e.g. the `NtpClock` requires a network
      request and can take multiple seconds.)
    * the `SystemClock` will synchronize against the `referenceClock` on a
      periodic basis using the non-blocking API of the `Clock` interface
    * the synchronization interval is a configurable parameter in the
      constructor (default, every 1 hour).
* the `backupClock`
    * an instance of the `Clock` class which preserves the time and *continues
      to tick* after the power is lost
    * e.g. `DS3231Clock` backed by a battery or a super capacitor
    * upon initialized, the `SystemClock` retrieves the current time
      from the `backupClock` so that the current time available in the
      `SystemClock` right away, without having to wait for synchronization with
      the slower `referenceClock` (e.g. the `NtpClock`).

Since both parameters are nullable, there are 4 combinations:

* `SystemClock(nullptr, nullptr)`
    * no referenceClock or backupClock
    * only the `millis()` function is used
* `SystemClock(referenceClock, nullptr)`
    * performs periodic syncing with referenceClock
    * if the referenceClock does not keep time after power loss, then the
      date/time much be reset after reinitialization
* `SystemClock(nullptr, backupClock)`
    * `millis()` used as the reference
    * date and time retrieve from backupClock upon initial startup
    * `backupClock` updated when `SystemClock::setNow()` is called
    * no further syncing happens to the backupClock
    * *Not Recommended*: It is difficult to see this configuration being useful.
* `SystemClock(referenceClock, backupClock)`
    * the `referenceClock` and `backupClock` will usually be different objects
    * using both provides redundancy and rapid initialization
    * see example below where the `referenceClock` is an `NtpClock` which can
      take many seconds to initialize, and the `backupClock` is a `DS3231` which
      can initialize the `SystemClock` quickly when the board restarts
    * this configuration allows the clock to keep working if the network goes
      down

An example of each configuration is given in the [SystemClock
Examples](#SystemClockExamples) section below.

There is some of special handling of the case where the referenceClock and the
backupClock are non-null and identical:

* `SystemClock(referenceClock, referenceClock)`
    * precaution taken to avoid updating the `backupClock` during `syncNow()`
    * avoids writing the same value back into the RTC, which would cause
      progressive loss of accuracy due to the overwriting of sub-second
      information
    * this configuration has the benefit of guaranteeing that the `SystemClock`
      returns a valid epochSeconds as soon as the `setup()` method returns
      successfully, because the `backupClock` is called in the `setup()` to
      initialize the `SystemClock`
    * see [DS3231 As Both Reference and Backup](#DS3231ReferenceAndBackup)
      example below

<a name="SystemClockMaintenance"></a>
#### SystemClock Maintenance Tasks

There are 2 internal maintenance tasks that must be performed periodically.

First, the `SystemClock` advances the internal `epochSeconds` counter using the
`millis()` function when the `getNow()` method is called. This functionality
is needed because on the AVR platform, the `time()` function does not
automatically advance. On other platforms, the `time()` function does not even
exist. For cross-platform compatibility, We are forced to use the `millis()`
function as a substitute. The synchronization with `millis()` must happen every
65.536 seconds or faster. Most of the time, this will not be problem because the
`getNow()` method will be called very frequently, say 10 times a second, to
detect a transition of the time from one second to the next second. But there
may be applications where `getNow()` is not called frequently, so the
`SystemClock` maintenance task must make sure that `getNow()` is called
frequently enough even if the calling application does not do so.

Second, if the `referenceClock` is given, the `SystemClock` should synchronize
its internal `epochSeconds` with the reference clock periodically.
The frequency of this sync'ing will likely depend on the accuracy of the
`millis()`, and how expensive the call to the `referenceClock` is. If the
`referenceClock` is a DS3231 chip, syncing once every 1-10 minutes might be
acceptable since talking to the RTC chip over I2C is relatively cheap. If the
`referenceClock` is the `NtpClock`, the network connection is fairly expensive
so maybe once every 1-12 hours might be advisable. Since the `SystemClock` does
not actually know what kind of `referenceClock` is attached to it, it needs to
be given a some reasonable default value. The current default value is every
**one hour**. This value can be changed in the constructor of one of the
following subclasses.

The `SystemClock` provides 2 subclasses which differ in the way they perform
these maintenance tasks:

* the `SystemClockLoop` class uses the `::loop()` method which should be called
  from the global `loop()` function, and
* the `SystemClockCoroutine` class uses the `::runCoroutine()` method which
  uses the AceRoutine library

<a name="SystemClockLoop"></a>
#### SystemClockLoop

This class synchronizes to the `referenceClock` through the
`SystemClockLoop::loop()` method that is meant to be called from the global
`loop()` method, like this:

```C++
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;
using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;
...

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(Wire);

SystemClockLoop systemClock(dsClock, nullptr /*backup*/);

void setup() {
  ...
  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  systemClock.setup();
  ...
}

void loop() {
  ...
  systemClock.loop();
  ...
}
```

`SystemClockLoop` keeps an internal counter to limit the syncing process to
every 1 hour. This is configurable through parameters in the `SystemClockLoop()`
constructor.

<a name="SystemClockCoroutine"></a>
#### SystemClockCoroutine

This class synchronizes to the `referenceClock` using an
[AceRoutine](https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine) coroutine.

```C++
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire
#include <AceRoutine.h> // include this before <AceTimeClock.h>
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;
using ace_time::clock::SystemClockCoroutine;
using ace_routine::CoroutineScheduler;
...

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(Wire);

SystemClockCoroutine systemClock(dsClock, nullptr /*backup*/);

void setup() {
  ...
  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  systemClock.setupCoroutine(F("systemClock"));
  CoroutineScheduler::setup();
  ...
}

void loop() {
  ...
  CoroutineScheduler::loop();
  ...
}
```

I suspect that most people will feel more comfortable using the
`SystemClockLoop` class. But if you are already using the AceRoutine library, it
may be more convenient to use the `SystemClockCoroutine` class instead.

<a name="SystemClockStatus"></a>
#### SystemClock Status Inspection

The `SystemClock` exposes a number of methods that allow inspection of its sync
status with the referenceClock.

```C++
class SystemClock: public Clock {
  public:
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusOk = 0;
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusError = 1;
    static const uint8_t kSyncStatusTimedOut = 2;

    ...

    acetime_t getLastSyncTime() const;
    uint8_t getSyncStatusCode() const;
    int32_t getSecondsSinceSyncAttempt() const;
    int32_t getSecondsToSyncAttempt() const;
    int16_t getClockSkew() const;
};
```

* `getLastSyncTime()`
    * the `acetime_t` time of the most recent **successful** syncing with the
      referenceClock
    * (there is no equilvalent `getLastFailedSyncTime()` method, because if the
      sync fails, we don't get the correct time, so we don't know what time it
      failed, but see `getSecondsSinceSyncAttempt()` below)
* `getSyncStatusCode()`
    * status code of the most recent attempt to sync with the referenceClock
* `getSecondsSinceSyncAttempt()`
    * number of seconds since the most recent sync attempt with the
      referenceClock, regardless whether it failed or succeeded
    * this a positive number, but it sometimes makes sense to display this
      number as a negative value, to indicate that it occurred in the past
    * elapsed time is extracted from the global `millis()` function
* `getSecondsToSyncAttempt()`
    * number of seconds estimated until the next sync attempt with the
      referenceClock
    * elapsed time is extracted from the global `millis()` function
* `getClockSkew()`
    * number of seconds that the `SystemClock` was slow (negative) or fast
      (postive) compared to the referenceClock, at the time of the most recent
      *successful* sync
    * if the syncing is done often enough, and the `millis()` function is
      reasonably calibrated, this value should be almost always `0`.

The quantities returned by the above methods can be fed into the `TimePeriod`
object to extract the hour, minute and second components.

<a name="SystemClockConfigurableParameters"></a>
#### System Clock Configurable Parameters

The constructors of both `SystemClockLoop` and `SystemClockCoroutine` take an
identical list of parameters, some of which have default values. This section
explains the meaning of those parameters. Both construtors look exactly like
this:

```C++
explicit SystemClockLoop(
    Clock* referenceClock /* nullable */,
    Clock* backupClock /* nullable */,
    uint16_t syncPeriodSeconds = 3600,
    uint16_t initialSyncPeriodSeconds = 5,
    uint16_t requestTimeoutMillis = 1000,
    ace_common::TimingStats* timingStats = nullptr);
```

* `syncPeriodSeconds`
    * Number of seconds between successive requests to the `referenceClock` to
      obtain the current time.
    * If requests to the `referenceClock` is cheap (e.g. `DS3231Clock` over
      I2C), then this value could be lowered (e.g. 1 minute) without much
      detriment.
    * If requests to the `referenceClock` is expensive (e.g. `NtpClock`) then
      this value should remain relatively large.
* `initialSyncPeriodSeconds`
    * Number of seconds to wait between the very first request to the
      `referenceClock` just after reboot, and the *second* request to the
      `referenceClock` if the first request fails.
    * If the request fails again, the `SystemClockLoop::loop()` and
      `SystemClockCoroutine::runCoroutine()` methods will use an [exponential
      backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) algorithm and
      double the number of seconds between each successive retry attempt.
    * The retry interval keeps increasing until it becomes greater than or equal
      to `syncPeriodSeconds`, after which the retry interval becomes pegged to
      `syncPeriodSeconds`.
* `requestTimeoutMillis`
    * Number of milliseconds to wait after making a request to the
      `referenceClock` before marking the request as timed out, and therefore,
      failed.
    * Note that since the non-blocking request API of `Clock` is used, other
      tasks continue to run while we wait for a response from the
      `referenceClock`.
* `timingStats`
    * An instance of `ace_common::TimingStats` used for debugging and
      benchmarking.
    * Application developers are not expected to use this normally.

<a name="SystemClockExamples"></a>
## SystemClock Examples

The examples below are shown using `SystemClockLoop` but `SystemClockCoroutine`
should also work.

<a name="NoReferenceAndNoBackup"></a>
### No Reference And No Backup

This is the most basic example of a `SystemClockLoop` that uses no
`referenceClock` or a `backupClock`. The accuracy of this clock is limited by
the accuracy of the internal `millis()` function, and the clock has no backup
against power failure. Upon reboot, the `SystemClockLoop::setNow()` must be
called to set the current time. The `SystemClockLoop::loop()` must still be
called to perform a maintenance task of incrementing the AceTime epochSeconds
returned by `SystemClockLoop::getNow()` using the progression of the Arduino
`millis()` function.

This configuration is not very practical, but it might be useful for quick
debugging.

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;

SystemClockLoop systemClock(nullptr /*reference*/, nullptr /*backup*/);
...

void setup() {
  systemClock.setup();
  ...
}

void loop() {
  systemClock.loop();
  ...
}
```

<a name="DS3231Reference"></a>
### DS3231 Reference

This `SystemClockLoop` uses a `DS3231Clock` as a `referenceClock`. No backup
clock is actually needed because the DS3231 RTC preserves its info as long as a
battery is connected to it. The `SystemClockLoop::loop()` advances the internal
`epochSeconds` every second using the `millis()` function, and it synchronizes
the `epochSeconds` to the `DS3231` clock every one hour (by default). In the
following example, the `DS3231Clock` is configured to use the `<Wire.h>` library
for I2C communication.

```C++
#include <AceTimeClock.h>
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire

using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;
using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

SystemClockLoop systemClock(&dsClock /*reference*/, nullptr /*backup*/);
...

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // wait for Leonardo/Micro

  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  systemClock.setup();
  ...
}

void loop() {
  systemClock.loop();
  ...
}
```

<a name="NtpReferenceWithDS3231Backup"></a>
### NTP Reference With DS3231 Backup

This is a more sophisticated example of a `SystemClockLoop` configured to use
the `NtpClock` as the `referenceClock` and the `DS3231Clock` as the
`backupClock`. Currently, the `NptClock` supports only the ESP8266 and the ESP32
microcontrollers, but it could be readily extended to support other controllers
which have network capabilities.

Every hour (by default), the `SystemClockLoop` makes a request to the `NtpClock`
to get the most accurate time. This is a network request that can potentially
take several seconds. Fortunately, `SystemClockLoop` uses the non-blocking API
of `NtpClock` when making this request, so everything else on the
microcontroller keeps running while the request is being fulfilled. When the
request to `NtpClock` is successful, the result is also written into the
`DS3231Clock` backup clock, just to keep it in sync as well.

(It just occurs to me that `Clock::setNow()` is a blocking call, so this code
assumes that updating the `backupClock` is a relatively quick operation. This
seems to me a reasonable assumption because a `backupClock` that takes a long
time to update does not seem like not a good candidate as a `backupClock`. But
let me know if my assumptions are incorrect.)

```C++
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;
using ace_time::clock::NtpClock;
using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

NtpClock ntpClock(SSID, PASSWORD);
SystemClockLoop systemClock(&ntpClock /*reference*/, &dsClock /*backup*/);
...

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // wait for Leonardo/Micro

  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  ntpClock.setup();
  systemClock.setup();
}

void loop() {
  systemClock.loop();
  ...
}
```

**Note**: This configuration does *not* provide fail-over. In other words, if
the `referenceClock` is unreachable, then the code does not automatically start
using the `backupClock` as the reference clock. The `backupClock` is used *only*
during initial startup to initialize the `SystemClockLoop`. If the network
continues to be unreachable for a long time, then the `SystemClockLoop` will be
only as accurate as the `millis()` function.

<a name="DS3231ReferenceAndBackup"></a>
### DS3231 As Both Reference and Backup

The `DS3231Clock` for example can be given as *both* the reference and backup
clock sources, like this:

```C++
#include <AceWire.h> // TwoWireInterface
#include <Wire.h> // TwoWire, Wire
#include <AceTimeClock.h>

using ace_time::clock::SystemClockLoop;
using ace_time::clock::DS3231Clock;

using WireInterface = ace_wire::TwoWireInterface<TwoWire>;
WireInterface wireInterface(Wire);
DS3231Clock<WireInterface> dsClock(wireInterface);

SystemClockLoop systemClock(&dsClock /*reference*/, &dsClock /*backup*/);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial); // wait for Leonardo/Micro

  Wire.begin();
  wireInterface.begin();
  dsClock.setup();
  systemClock.setup();
}

void loop() {
  systemClock.loop();
  ...
}
```

The `SystemClockLoop` will notice that the `referenceClock` is the same as the
`backupClock`, and will take precautions to avoid writing to the  `backupClock`
in the `syncNow()` method. Otherwise, there would be progressive skewing the
`referenceClock`. To see how this would happen, recall that the `referenceClock`
is the original source of the `epochSeconds` given to `syncNow()`. If the
`epochSeconds` is written back into the `referenceClock` (through the
`backupClock` reference), then the internal subsecond resolution of the RTC
would be lost, and the RTC would lose a small fraction of a second each time
`syncNow()` is called.

The biggest advantage of using this configuration (where the same clock is used
as `referenceClock` and `backupClock`) is guarantee a valid state of
`SystemClockLoop` after a successful call to `setup()`. Without a `backupClock`,
the `SystemClockLoop::getNow()` returns a `kInvalidSeconds` error condition
until the first successful `syncNow()` complete. With a `backupClock`, the
`SystemClockLoop::setup()` blocks until a valid time is retrieved from the
`backupClock`, uses that value to initialize the `SystemClockLoop`. The
`getNow()` method will always return a valid vlaue (as long as both reference
and backup clock remain valid).

In summary, if your application can tolerate a short period (order of seconds or
less) where the `SystemClockLoop::getNow()` can return `kInvalidSeconds`, then
you can use just define the reference clock without reusing it as a backup
clock, `SystemClockLoop(&dsClock, nullptr)`. For robustness, most applications
should be written to tolerate and correctly handle this situation anyways, but I
understand that people want to do the least amount of work, and handling error
conditions is more work. Configuring the `referenceClock` as the `backupClock`
provides a slightly better well-behaved `SystemClockLoop`, at the expense of
having possibility that the setup process of the application could take longer.

This library does not perform dynamic allocation of memory so that it can be
used in small microcontroller environments. In other words, it does not call the
`new` operator nor the `malloc()` function, and it does not use the Arduino
`String` class. Everything it needs is allocated statically at initialization
time.

An example of more complex application is the
WorldClock (https://github.com/bxparks/clocks/tree/master/WorldClock)
which has 3 OLED displays over SPI, 3 timezones using `BasicZoneProcessor`, a
`SystemClock` synchronized to a DS3231 chip on I2C, and 2 buttons with
debouncing and event dispatching provided by the AceButton
(https://github.com/bxparks/AceButton) library. This application consumes about
24 kB, well inside the 28 kB flash limit of a SparkFun Pro Micro controller.

## System Requirements

<a name="Hardware"></a>
### Hardware

**Tier 1: Fully supported**

These boards are tested on each release:

* Arduino Nano (16 MHz ATmega328P)
* SparkFun Pro Micro (16 MHz ATmega32U4)
* STM32 Blue Pill (STM32F103C8, 72 MHz ARM Cortex-M3)
* NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E module, 80 MHz ESP8266)
* WeMos D1 Mini (ESP-12E module, 80 MHz ESP8266)
* ESP32 dev board (ESP-WROOM-32 module, 240 MHz dual core Tensilica LX6)
* Teensy 3.2 (96 MHz ARM Cortex-M4)

**Tier 2: Should work**

These boards should work but I don't test them as often:

* ATtiny85 (8 MHz ATtiny85)
* Arduino Pro Mini (16 MHz ATmega328P)
* Mini Mega 2560 (Arduino Mega 2560 compatible, 16 MHz ATmega2560)
* Teensy LC (48 MHz ARM Cortex-M0+)
* STM32F411 Black Pill (STM32F411CEU6, 100 MHz ARM Cortex-M4)

**Tier 3: May work, but not supported**

* SAMD21 M0 Mini (48 MHz ARM Cortex-M0+)
    * Arduino-branded SAMD21 boards use the ArduinoCore-API, so are explicitly
      blacklisted. See below.
    * Other 3rd party SAMD21 boards *may* work using the SparkFun SAMD core.
    * However, as of SparkFun SAMD Core v1.8.6 and Arduino IDE 1.8.19, I can no
      longer upload binaries to these 3rd party boards due to errors.
    * Therefore, third party SAMD21 boards are now in this new Tier 3 category.
    * The AceTime library may work on these boards, but I can no longer support
      them.

**Tier Blacklisted**

The following boards are *not* supported and are explicitly blacklisted to allow
the compiler to print useful error messages instead of hundreds of lines of
compiler errors:

* Any platform using the ArduinoCore-API
  (https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-api), such as:
    * megaAVR (e.g. Nano Every)
    * SAMD21 boards w/ `arduino:samd` version >= 1.8.10 (e.g. Nano 33 IoT,
      MKRZero, etc)
    * Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040

  [ArduinoCore-API](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-api), for example:
    * [Arduino megaAVR](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-megaavr/)
    * [MegaCoreX](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX)
    * [Arduino SAMD Boards >=1.8.10](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd)

It should work with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) but I have
not tested it.

The library works on Linux or MacOS (using both g++ and clang++ compilers) using
the EpoxyDuino (https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) emulation layer.

<a name="OperatingSystem"></a>
### Operating System

I use Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 for the vast majority of my development. I expect
that the library will work fine under MacOS and Windows, but I have not tested
them.

<a name="Bugs"></a>
## Bugs and Limitations

* `NtpClock`
    * The `NtpClock` on an ESP8266 calls `WiFi.hostByName()` to resolve
      the IP address of the NTP server. Unfortunately, when I tested this
      library, it seems to be a blocking call (later versions may have fixed
      this). When the DNS resolver is working properly, this call returns in
      ~10ms or less. But sometimes, the DNS resolver seems to get into a state
      where it takes 4-5 **seconds** to time out. Even if you use AceRoutine
      coroutines, the entire program will block for those 4-5 seconds.
    * [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) uses an epoch
      of 1900-01-01T00:00:00Z, with 32-bit unsigned integer as the seconds
      counter. It will overflow just after 2036-02-07T06:28:15Z.

## Feedback and Support

If you have any questions, comments, or feature requests for this library,
please use the [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock/discussions) for this
project. If you have bug reports, please file a ticket in [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeClock/issues). Feature requests should
go into Discussions first because they often have alternative solutions which
are useful to remain visible, instead of disappearing from the default view of
the Issue tracker after the ticket is closed.

Please refrain from emailing me directly unless the content is sensitive. The
problem with email is that I cannot reference the email conversation when other
people ask similar questions later.
